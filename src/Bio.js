        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Graham Freundlich. I am a fullstack software developer based out of Boston Mass. In may of 2022 I sparked an interest in coding and started self teaching myself through free online resources. After about 7 months of this, I decided that it was time to persure this as a career path. As a result, I enrolled in a 9 month MERN fullstack web development program with Kenzie Academy. It was an amazing experience that I feel has truly prepared me for a future as a web developer. </p>
